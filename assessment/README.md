## Objective

Your assignment is to create an API documentation system using Java and Spring that will automatically generate documentation for your API endpoints.

## Brief

API documentation is an important part of any API development process. It helps developers understand how to use your API, and can make it much easier to maintain and update the API in the future.

Your task is to create a system that will automatically generate documentation for your API endpoints. This should include information about the available endpoints, what parameters they accept, and what responses they return.

## Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: Java
    -   Framework: Spring
-   Your system should automatically generate documentation for all of your API endpoints
-   The documentation should include:
    -   A list of available endpoints
    -   The HTTP methods supported by each endpoint
    -   The parameters each endpoint accepts, including their data type and whether they are required or optional
    -   The response format for each endpoint, including any error responses
-   Your system should be able to handle any changes to the API endpoints automatically
-   _Do not use pre-built API documentation tools like Swagger or API Blueprint_.

## Bonus Tasks

-   Your system should allow users to test endpoints directly from the documentation
-   The documentation should provide an interface for making test requests against each endpoint, using the appropriate HTTP method and parameters
    The test interface should allow users to specify any required authentication credentials

### Help

Introspection can be useful for this challenge as it allows you to inspect the schema of your API at runtime. With introspection, you can programmatically retrieve information about your API, such as the available endpoints, data types, and responses. This can be useful for automatically generating documentation for your API and ensuring that it is always up-to-date. Additionally, introspection can be used to implement features such as the ability to run requests against the API from the documentation, as well as the ability to specify authentication credentials or API keys.

## Evaluation Criteria

-   Java best practices
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Documentation: is the API documentation clear and easy to understand?

## CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
